<p>In this module, we will study convolutional neural networks (CNN) in depth. We will start with an introduction to the convolution operation and intuitions as to why they are useful. We will then focus on the building blocks of CNNS. After that, we will look at modern CNN architectures with a particular emphasis on computer vision applications. We will look at the various building blocks of modern CNNs, influential datasets and applications of CNNs.</p>
