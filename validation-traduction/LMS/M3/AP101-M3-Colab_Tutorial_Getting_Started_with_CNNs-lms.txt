<p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to your third tutorial!<img src="/static/COLAB.png" alt="" style="margin-top: -40px; position: relative; display: block;" width="70" height="70" /></p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn that choosing the right architecture relative to your data structure is necessary to obtain good performances. We will compare a generic multi-layer perceptron with the famous convolutional neural network LeNet. You will also use batch normalization to improve the results. Then, we will again encounter the difficulty of having a small number of labeled examples in a classification task. Here, to cope with this difficulty, we will use transfer learning by using a pre-trained CNN and fine-tuning it on 120 annotated images of the new task.</p>

<!-- Second Block after video -->
<p>Congratulations! You now understand why finding the right architecture is essential in any ML project. You have also discovered that transfer learning, eventually combined with data augmentation, is a powerful technique to help the model to generalize, even when the training set is small.</p>
