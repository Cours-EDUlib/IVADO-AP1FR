<p>Jeremy focuses on the convolution operation - the core mathematical operation involved in CNNs - with an example. He introduces some mathematical formalism to understand convolution and presents useful animations to understand how the convolution works in 1D and 2D.</p>
<p>The content as of minute 7:00 in this video may be of particular interest to those with a background in signal processing or those who are familiar with other types of convolutions.</p>
