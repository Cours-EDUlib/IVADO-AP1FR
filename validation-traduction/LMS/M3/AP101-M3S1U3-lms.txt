<p>Jeremy presents a modular view of CNNs by presenting typical building blocks and how they can be used to assemble complex architectures. He presents the different steps involved in the building blocks, including convolutions, activation functions, pooling functions, etc. Understanding this modular approach to CNNs is key to visualizing CNN architecture on a bigger scale. He also presents how to transform the output volumes to probability distributions through a dense fully connected layer, followed by a softmax. He explains the intuition behind the addition of this component to CNN architectures.</p>
