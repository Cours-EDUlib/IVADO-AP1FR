<p>Jeremy begins his dive into gradient descent in CNNs. Understanding how gradient descent takes place in CNNs is useful to understand to become a good deep learning practitioner. These details are rarely ever implemented in practice, but it is useful to know the chain of operations involved in most deep learning libraries.</p>
<p>*Warning: This is a math intensive video. Please do not be deterred: only a global understanding of the math is necessary, but the finer points must simply be overviewed.*</p>
