<p>Jeremy breaks down structured outputs, a method to predict multiple outputs that relate to each other, such as object detection and image segmentation. He looks at the different ways to represent these outputs and the metrics associated to evaluate the network’s performance. The content in this video is key to using CNNs for tasks that require outputs that are more sophisticated than a classification of the entire image.</p>
