<p style="text-align: center;">Great job! You have made it to the fourth assessment!<img src="/static/SommativeAssessment.png" alt="" style="margin-top: -40px; position: relative; display: block;" width="70" height="70" /></p>
<p>The following ten (10) questions will assess how well you have grasped the main concepts related to RNN, sequence-to sequence architectures, and NLP. <br /><br />You will get two (2) attempts to answer each question and only 1 (one) attempt for true-or-false type questions. Remember that assessment questions equate to 100% of your final grade. A certificate will be issued upon obtaining the passing grade of ≥ 70 for the course. You are welcome to use hints if you see those.</p>
<p>The best of luck!</p>
