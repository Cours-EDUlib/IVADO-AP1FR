<p>Mirko presents Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in detail along with a running example. He breaks down the key features of RNNs with clear diagrams to present the architecture. He also presents the two equations that are used to implement the "tanh" RNNs. This video contains the key intuitions and mathematical formalisms necessary to understand RNNs and to progress further in this course.</p>
