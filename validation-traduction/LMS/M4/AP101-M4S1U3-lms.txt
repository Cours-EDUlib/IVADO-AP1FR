<p>Mirko details the training phase of the RNN, sharing key features of the architecture and how to apply gradient-based methods to optimize the parameters. He breaks down the backpropagation algorithm applied to RNNs step by step, known as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). The content of this video is very important to understand how the shared parameters are updated, and it sets the scene for the potential problems that can be encountered during training.</p>
