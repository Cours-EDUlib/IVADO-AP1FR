<p>Mirko provides another hypothesis about the vanishing gradient problem, also showing how a gating mechanism could mitigate this problem. This naturally leads to the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures. Mirko analyses in detail the equations that govern the LSTM architecture.</p>
