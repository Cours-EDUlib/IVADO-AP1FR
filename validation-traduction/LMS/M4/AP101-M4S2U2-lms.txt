<p>Mirko introduces the Sequence-to-Sequence model by explaining the encoder-decoder structure at its core. He also details how to implement a decoder by using an autoregressive approach, which helps in generating consistent outputs across time. He presents an example of a Sequence-to-Sequence model to help the viewer gain intuition about what is taking place inside the encoder-decoder architecture.</p>
