<p>Mirko presents two key problems with RNNs: the inability to parallelize the computation, as well as the difficulty in handling very long term dependencies - even with more sophisticated architecture such as the LSTM. Understanding the problems with RNNs that Mirko presents in this video is necessary to be able to grasp how the Transformer architecture gets around these problems, and why the RNN architecture could not.</p>
