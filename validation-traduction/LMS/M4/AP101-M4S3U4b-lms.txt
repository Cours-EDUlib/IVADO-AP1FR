<p>Mirko follows his previous video by presenting two strategies for word embeddings, known as Word2Vec and FastText. He details how the Word2Vec algorithm works and gives an insight on how FastText improves this idea. Mirko introduces the notion of pre-training, which is used for knowledge transferring, in particular in cases where there is a scarce amount of data in the task of interest.</p>
