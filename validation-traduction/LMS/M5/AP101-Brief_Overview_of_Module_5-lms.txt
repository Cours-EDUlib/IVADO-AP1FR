<p>In this module, you will learn about algorithmic discrimination in machine learning. Specifically, various definitions and concepts of fairness will be explored in-depth to give you an understanding as to how models can be discriminatory, and fairness is far from guaranteed when building and using machine learning models.</p>
<p>Fairness is a slippery concept with no specific definition. We will overview various theorems and mathematical definitions of fairness to interpret the nuances of what it means for a model to be “fair”. We will see interesting results such as the impossibility theorem, which states that not all definitions of fairness can be met simultaneously.</p>
<p>We will also familiarize ourselves with many pitfalls of fairness along with the various phases of preprocessing, processing, and postprocessing. There are many opportunities and challenges when it comes to algorithmic discrimination in machine learning. In the end, you will understand these, as well as the impact that fairness can have on machine learning.</p>
