<p>Golnoosh Farnadi, Ph. D., IVADO Postdoctoral Researcher at Université de Montréal, introduces the idea of algorithmic discrimination, a crucial topic regarding the fairness of machine learning. She elaborates on why overall accuracy is not a good enough measure to say that a machine learning model is fair, but also on why we should care about fairness in ML and its inherent subjectivity. This video is paramount since it is important that ML not create more and bigger problems than it is actually used to solve.</p>
