<p>Golnoosh overviews different definitions of fairness. She overviews indirect discrimination, where a rule that applies equally to all may affect some more than others in a systematically detrimental way. She also contrasts group fairness and individual fairness and introduces the impossibility theorem: not all definitions of fairness can be satisfied simultaneously. This video will help you understand the complexity of fairness and the nuances in choosing a proper definition of fairness to avoid discrimination.</p>
