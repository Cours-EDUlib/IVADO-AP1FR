<p>Golnoosh introduces the idea of fairness constraints in the optimization problem, as well as potential difficulties arising from these additional constraints. She also provides two examples. The first example, fair Naive Bayes (2:30-3:18), introduces concepts above the level of this course and therefore only a cursory understanding is necessary. The second example introduces fairness in relational domains. Golnoosh closes by stating that every problem needs a detailed solution to include fairness in the optimization process.</p>
